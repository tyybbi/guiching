# Hexing

A simple I Ching hexagram generator, that uses Go backend and template
to serve stuff onto an HTML page.

## Usage

Run **hexing** by `go build && ./hexing` or just by `go run *.go` in the project
root directory. Then, in a web browser, visit http://localhost:8080 to
see your newly generated hexagram(s).

### Notes

- The app does not use any JavaScript/Ajax etc. so just refresh the page to generate
  new shapes.
